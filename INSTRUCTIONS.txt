💼 Professional Distribution Process:
Create Standard Package Template:

# Your template folder structure
VISIT-Template/
├── app/ (with placeholder license)
├── scripts/
├── media/ (empty folders)
├── VISIT_Installation_Guide.pdf
└── README.md

For Each Client:

Copy template folder
Generate their specific license
Replace placeholder license with theirs
Rename folder to their museum name

🚀 Automated Distribution Script:
You could create a script to automate this process:

# Future enhancement: automated client package creator
# This would:
# 1. Prompt for museum details
# 2. Generate license automatically
# 3. Create client package
# 4. Zip for distribution

Your VISIT system is now ready for professional distribution to museums worldwide! Each client gets a customized, licensed installation that's easy to set up and use.
